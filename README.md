# 🧠 Sign Language Detector – Web App Edition

A real-time **Sign Language Detection** system built with **Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe**, and **TensorFlow**, deployed as a simple **web application** using **Flask** and **HTML**.

This project is based on [Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJCSjXepaAM), which originally supported only 3 signs (**A, B, L**) and was designed as a desktop app. I adapted and **expanded** it into a **web app** with support for **14 unique hand signs**.

## ✨ What’s New

- ✅ Converted from desktop to **web-based UI**
- ✅ Used **simple HTML** for frontend interface
- ✅ Flask-powered backend for real-time prediction
- ✅ Extended the model from 3 labels to **14 meaningful sign language gestures**

---

## 🤟 Detected Signs
The updated model can recognize the following 14 hand signs: Bad, Rock, Yes, Paper, Hello, Scissor, Good, Okey, ILoveYou, No, Help, angry, happy, delicious
